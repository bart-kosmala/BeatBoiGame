All music uploaded by me as demo is my own property, and it is therefore free to use.
I do not support mapping music that belongs to other people without their approval.
Share your maps only when you are sure no rights are being broken.

[**v1.0 DOWNLOAD**](https://www.mediafire.com/file/zxkpqg76eipmac6/BeatBoi_v1.0.rar/file)

To create your own maps simply create a folder in the "./data/songs/" directory and then paste there:
* Your song in ".wav" format as "music.wav".
* A dot hitting sound in the same format as "hitsound.wav".
* A hit missing sound also in ".wav" as "misssound.wav".
* A "data.bin" file which contains the tempo of the song in the first line (in BPM) and a boolean chart of the map.

For reference look up to provided examples.

If you're experiencing some kind of tempo offset try to modify the value stored in "./data/offset.bb". 
Open the file in notepad and experiment with the value to minimize the lag.

_The release also contains a python script for generating random maps. Enter the information you're asked for concerning the song and it will generate a "data.bin" file with a random chart ready to play._

**Have fun!**
